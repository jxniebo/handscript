Patterns

Q:[DESIGN] What is design pattern?

Design patterns capture solutions that have evolved over time as developers strive for greater flexibility in their software. Whereas class libraries are reusable source code, and components are reusable packaged objects, patterns are generic, reusable design descriptions that are customized to solve a specific problem. The study of design patterns provides a common vocabulary for communication and documentation, and it provides a framework for evolution and improvement of existing patterns.

Q:[DESIGN] Name 3 design pattern?

* What are singleton beans and how can you create prototype beans?

Beans defined in spring framework are singleton beans. There is an attribute in bean tag named ‘singleton’ if specified true then bean becomes singleton and if set to false then the bean becomes a prototype bean. By default it is set to true. So, all the beans in spring framework are by default singleton beans.

* Explain Bean-LifeCycle.


    The spring container finds the bean’s definition from the XML file and instantiates the bean.
    Using the dependency injection, spring populates all of the properties as specified in the bean definition.
    If the bean implements the BeanNameAware interface, the factory calls setBeanName() passing the bean’s ID.
    If the bean implements the BeanFactoryAware interface, the factory calls setBeanFactory(), passing an instance of itself.
    If there are any BeanPostProcessors associated with the bean, their post- ProcessBeforeInitialization() methods will be called.
    If an init-method is specified for the bean, it will be called.
    Finally, if there are any BeanPostProcessors associated with the bean, their postProcessAfterInitialization() methods will be called.
